"""Save a payment method token (pmt) for a user.

When the user fills out the payment details form in the UI, we POST the new
info to Samurai (using the Samurai js library, which wraps a cross-site AJAX
library). Samurai always gives us a payment method token in return, no matter
how bad the info was that we POSTed. This present script is called next. It
takes the pmt and tries to bill or resume billing with it. The proof of the
pudding, as they say, is in the eating. If the attempt fails, we will ask the
customer to re-enter their details.
