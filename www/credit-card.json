"""Save a payment method token (balanced_account_uri) for a user.

When the user fills out the payment details form in the UI, we send the new
info to Balanced (using the balanced.js library). Balanced always gives us a
so-called "single-use token" in return, provided that the credit card info
validated. This present script is called next. It takes the token and tries to
associate it with a Balanced account object (creating one as needed).
