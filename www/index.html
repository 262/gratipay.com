    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>Logstown&rsquo;s mission is to <b>bootstrap a gift economy</b>.
    Imagine walking down the street and a bunch of your local townsfolk are
    lined up sitting there alongside a slew of celebrities and a random
    assortment of other humans. Each one is doing their own thing and has a
    jar out. You have a few bucks in your pocket and you&rsquo;re in a good
    mood. <b>Who would you tip?</b></p>

    <p>There&rsquo;s something called a <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Fellows_Program">genius
        grant</a> that the MacArthur Foundation gives to about 30 people
    each year. It&rsquo;s ten million dollars over five years, <b>no
        strings attached</b>. &ldquo;Just keep being a genius. Please spend
    another five years making the world better for the rest of us.&rdquo;
    The winners don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re in the running until
    they get the phone call that they won.</p>
    
    <p>Logstown is <b>genius grants for the rest of us</b>. Call them
    pretty-smart grants, or crowd-sourced genius grants.</p>

    <p>Logstown is for the local coffee shop owner that&rsquo;s really
    doing a lot for your town. You&rsquo;re a fan. You buy coffee from her,
    but you want to do something more&mdash;a little something, not a big
    deal. If a hundred other people in your town feel the same way, it
    starts to add up. Now she can offer free coffee on Sunday mornings. Or
    whatever. She knows what she&rsquo;s doing. No strings attached.</p>

    <p>Logstown is for the musician who gives their music away for free.
    You love their work. You go to their shows, you actually pay for the
    downloads, but you want to make sure their family is covered. You want
    to chip in&mdash;a little something&mdash;so they&rsquo;re freed up to
    make great music.</p>

    <p>Logstown is for your favorite open source developer. You study their
    code, and you implicitly trust any software they write. You want to free
    them up to write even more of it.</p>
    
    <p>Logstown is voluntary <b>welfare for productive people</b>.</p>

    <p>Logstown is <b>Kickstarter for people</b> (not just projects).</p>

    <p>Logstown is <b>Flattr for people</b> (not just content).</p>

    <p>Logstown is a <b>gift economy</b> implemented atop the global
    exchange economy.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>Tips are <b>weekly</b>. One-off contributions aren&rsquo;t enough.
    Expenses are ongoing. Income must be, too.</p>

    <p>Tips are <b>anonymous</b>. The people you tip aren&rsquo;t told who
    tipped them. Also, you can&rsquo;t tip more then $2.49 a week. This
    way, tips come with <b>no strings attached</b>. Alice works on whatever
    she wants to work on. Bob tips whomever he wants to tip.</p>

    <p>Tips are <b>public</b>. The amount you give is private, but the
    total amount you receive is public. Tip income closely reflects benefit
    to society, so calling out high earners encourages <b>true value
        creation</b>. Alice is concretely rewarded by a thousand Bobs for
    contributing to society.</p>

    <p>Logstown distributes <b>tips every Friday</b>. Tips come out of your
    current balance (the money people have tipped you), and if that&rsquo;s not
    enough, Logstown charges your credit card to make up the difference. We add
    an additional <b>10&cent; + 3.9%</b> fee when pulling money in from your
    credit card, to cover credit card processing, hosting, and other expenses.
    For example, let&rsquo;s say that you have $10 in your account, and you are
    set up to tip $1.99 to ten people. Here&rsquo;s what we will charge your
    credit card on Friday:</p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: smaller; padding-left: 40%;">
        &nbsp;$&nbsp;1.99<br />
        <u>x&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><br />
        &nbsp;$19.90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total tips<br />
        <u>-$10.00</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current balance<br />
        &nbsp;$&nbsp;9.90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount needed<br />
        <u>+$ 0.10</u><br />
        &nbsp;$10.00<br />
        <u>x&nbsp;&nbsp;1.039</u><br />
        &nbsp;<b>$10.39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount charged</b>
    </p>

    <p>Recipients get the full face value of your tip to them. If you tip
    someone $1.99, they will have $1.99 in their Logstown account every
    Friday until your credit card expires. Participants can withdraw funds
    from their Logstown account at any time.</p>
