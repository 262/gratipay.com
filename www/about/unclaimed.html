<h2>Gittip happens every Thursday.</h2>

<p>The amounts above are what the Gittip community is willing to give as
a weekly gift to each person, but only if the person accepts it. Gittip is
<b>opt-in</b>. We never collect money on a person&rsquo;s behalf until that
person opts-in by claiming their account.</p>

<p class="help">Amounts represent pledges from people with a
{% if user.ANON %}working credit card{% else %}<a href="/credit-card.html">working credit
    card</a>{%end%} on file, to people who have neither joined Gittip nor
explicitly opted out. Only accounts with at least $1.00 in pledges
are listed.</p>
