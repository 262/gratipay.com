    <h2>What Is Gittip?</h2>

    <p>Gittip is a way to give <b>small weekly cash gifts</b> to people you
    love and are inspired by.</p>

    <p>Gittips are <b>weekly</b>. Eventually we want people depending on Gittip
    to pay their mortgage. Mortgages are *ahem* recurring.</p>

    <p>Gittips are <b>anonymous</b>. The people you gittip aren&rsquo;t told
    who tipped them. Also, you can&rsquo;t gittip more than $24 a week per
    person. No strings attached! Also, reduced social awkwardness. No
    &ldquo;why&rsquo;d you stop tipping me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Gittips are <b>public</b>. The <i>total</i> amount you give and the
    <i>total</i> amount you receive is public. Participants on both sides of
    the equation are rewarded publicly for their participation.</p>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>Gittips are distributed <b>every Thursday</b>. Gittips come out of your
    current balance (the money people have gifted you), and if that&rsquo;s not
    enough, Gittip can charge your credit card to make up the difference. We
    add an additional <b>30&cent; + 3.9%</b> fee when pulling money in from
    your credit card, to cover credit card processing (as well as hosting and
    other expenses). We also charge you no less than <b>$10</b> to minimize
    credit card processing fees. Any extra remains in your account to be used
    next week. Recipients get the <b>full face value</b> of your gift to them.
    If you give someone $3, they will have $3 in their Gittip account every
    Thursday until you run out of money.</p>

    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that you have $2.00 in your account, and
    you are set up to give $1.00 each to 20 people. Here&rsquo;s what we will
    charge your credit card on Thursday:</p>
