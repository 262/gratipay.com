    <h2>What Is Gittip?</h2>

    <p>Gittip is a way to give <b>small weekly cash gifts</b> to people you
    love and are inspired by.</p>

    <p>Gifts are <b>weekly</b>. The intention is for people to depend on
    Gittip to pay their mortgage, and mortgages are recurring.</p>

    <p>Gifts are <b>anonymous</b>. The people you give to aren&rsquo;t told
    who gives them. Also, you can&rsquo;t give more than $24 per week per
    person. This way gifts come with no strings attached (no, &ldquo;You owe
    me!&rdquo;), which reduces social awkwardness (no, &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you
    stop tipping me?&rdquo;).</p>

    <p>Gifts are <b>public</b>. The <i>total</i> amount you give and the
    <i>total</i> amount you receive is public. Participants on both sides of
    the equation are rewarded publicly for their participation. (You can opt
    out of displaying your giving publicly.)</p>

    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>Gittips are distributed <b>every Thursday</b>. Gittips come out of your
    current balance (the money people have gifted you), and if that&rsquo;s not
    enough, Gittip can charge your credit card to make up the difference. We
    add an additional <b>30&cent; + 3.9%</b> fee when pulling money in from
    your credit card, to cover credit card processing (as well as hosting and
    other expenses). We also charge you no less than <b>$10</b> to minimize
    credit card processing fees. Any extra remains in your account to be used
    next week. Recipients get the <b>full face value</b> of your gift to them.
    If you give someone $3, they will have $3 in their Gittip account every
    Thursday until you run out of money.</p>

    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that you have $2.00 in your account, and
    you are set up to give $1.00 each to 20 people. Here&rsquo;s what we will
    charge your credit card on Thursday:</p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: smaller; padding-left: 33%;">
        &nbsp;$&nbsp;1.00<br />
        <u>x&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people<br />
        &nbsp;$20.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total gittips<br />
        <u>-$&nbsp;2.00</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current balance<br />

        &nbsp;$18.30<br />
        <u>x&nbsp;&nbsp;1.039</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;fee<br />

        &nbsp;$&nbsp;1.02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total fee<br />

    <p>Participants in the U.S. can <a

        href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/30116848405/with-payouts-gittip-is-minimally-viable">deposited
        weekly</a> (less a $0.30 fee). It takes one business day for deposits
    to clear, so generally they will <b>clear on Friday</b>. We&rsquo;re

        href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/126">outside the
        U.S.</a> Right now they&rsquo;re handled manually&mdash;<a

    <h2>Get Involved</h2>

    <p>Anyone is free and invited to help build Gittip. <a
        href="http://www.zetaweb.com/">Zetaweb</a> is the organization behind
    Gittip, and we use two main tools to coordinate our work:</p>
    
    <ul>

        <li><b>GitHub</b> (different than Gittip!) is a <a
            href="https://github.com/zetaweb">collaboration platform</a>
        designed specifically for software teams. Anyone can register an
        account there and participate in discussions on any issues related to
        Gittip.</li>

        <li><b>Freenode</b> is an internet relay chat (IRC) network. It&rsquo;s
        for online chatrooms. We hang out in the <a
            href="irc://irc.freenode.net:6697/#gittip">#gittip</a> channel,
        which is <a href="https://botbot.me/freenode/gittip/">logged
            here</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We also use Skype and Google Hangouts to talk by voice and/or video. Our
    Freenode chatroom is the launching place for these conversations.</p>
