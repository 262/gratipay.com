    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>Gittip&rsquo;s mission is to <b>jump start a gift economy</b>. Tips are
    the foundation.</p>
    
    <p>Imagine walking down the street and a bunch of your local townsfolk are
    lined up sitting there alongside a slew of celebrities and a random
    assortment of other humans. Each one is doing their own thing and has a jar
    out. You have a few bucks in your pocket and you&rsquo;re in a good mood.
    <b>Who would you tip?</b></p>

    <p>There&rsquo;s something called a <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Fellows_Program">genius
        grant</a> that the MacArthur Foundation gives to about 30 people
    each year. It&rsquo;s ten million dollars over five years, <b>no
        strings attached</b>. &ldquo;Just keep being a genius. Please spend
    another five years making the world better for the rest of us.&rdquo;
    The winners don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re in the running until
    they get the phone call that they won.</p>
    
    <p>Gittip is <b>genius grants for the rest of us</b>. Call them
    pretty-smart grants, or crowd-sourced genius grants.</p>

    <p>Gittip is for the local coffee shop owner that&rsquo;s really
    doing a lot for your town. You&rsquo;re a fan. You buy coffee from her,
    but you want to do something more&mdash;a little something, not a big
    deal. If a hundred other people in your town feel the same way, it
    starts to add up. Now she can offer free coffee on Sunday mornings. Or
    whatever. She knows what she&rsquo;s doing. No strings attached.</p>

    <p>Gittip is for the musician who gives their music away for free.
    You love their work. You go to their shows, you actually pay for the
    downloads, but you want to make sure their family is covered. You want
    to chip in&mdash;a little something&mdash;so they&rsquo;re freed up to
    make great music.</p>

    <p>Gittip is for your favorite open source developer. You study their
    code, and you implicitly trust any software they write. You want to free
    them up to write even more of it.</p>
    
    <p>Gittip is voluntary <b>welfare for productive people</b>.</p>

    <p>Gittip is <b>Kickstarter for people</b> (not just projects).</p>

    <p>Gittip is <b>Flattr for people</b> (not just content).</p>

    <p>Gittip is a <b>gift economy</b> implemented atop the global
    exchange economy.</p>
    

    <a name="details"></a> 
    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>Tips are <b>weekly</b>. One-off contributions aren&rsquo;t enough.
    Expenses are ongoing. Income must be, too.</p>

    <p>Tips are <b>anonymous</b>. The people you tip aren&rsquo;t told who
    tipped them. Also, you can&rsquo;t tip more than $1.28 a week. This way,
    tips come with <b>no strings attached</b>. Alice works on whatever she
    wants to work on. Bob tips whomever he wants to tip.</p>

    <p>Tips are <b>public</b>. The amount you give is private, but the
    total amount you receive is public. Tip income closely reflects benefit
    to society, so calling out high earners encourages <b>true value
        creation</b>. Alice is concretely rewarded by a thousand Bobs for
    contributing to society.</p>

    <p>Tips are distributed <b>every Friday</b>. Tips come out of your current
    balance (the money people have tipped you), and if that&rsquo;s not enough,
    Gittip charges your credit card to make up the difference. We add an
    additional <b>10&cent; + 3.9%</b> fee when pulling money in from your
    credit card, to cover credit card processing (as well as hosting and other
    expenses). Recipients get the <b>full face value</b> of your tip to them.
    If you tip someone $1.28, they will have $1.28 in their Gittip account
    every Friday until you run out of money.</p>

    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that you have $5 in your account, and you
    are set up to tip $0.64 to 20 people. Here&rsquo;s what we will charge your
    credit card on Friday:</p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: smaller; padding-left: 33%;">
        &nbsp;$&nbsp;0.64<br />
        <u>x&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><br />
        &nbsp;$12.80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total tips<br />
        <u>-$&nbsp;5.00</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current balance<br />
        &nbsp;<b>$&nbsp;7.80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount needed</b><br />
        <u>+$&nbsp;0.10</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fee<br />
        &nbsp;$&nbsp;7.90<br />
        <u>x&nbsp;&nbsp;1.039</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;fee<br />
        &nbsp;<b>$&nbsp;8.21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount charged</b><br />
        <u>-$&nbsp;7.80</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;$&nbsp;0.41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total fee<br />
    </p>

    <p>Participants can withdraw funds from their Gittip account at any
    time.</p>
