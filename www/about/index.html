    <h2>What&rsquo;s a gittip?</h2>

    <p>Gittips (short for &ldquo;gift tips&rdquo;) are <b>small gifts of money
        with no strings attached</b>.</p>

    <p>Imagine walking down the street and a bunch of your local townsfolk are
    lined up sitting there alongside a slew of celebrities and a random
    assortment of other humans. Each one is doing their own thing and has a jar
    out. You have a few bucks in your pocket and you&rsquo;re in a good mood.
    <b>Who would you tip?</b></p>

    <p>There&rsquo;s something called a <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Fellows_Program">genius
        grant</a> that the MacArthur Foundation gives to about 30 people
    each year. It&rsquo;s ten million dollars over five years, <b>no
        strings attached</b>. &ldquo;Just keep being a genius. Please spend
    another five years making the world better for the rest of us.&rdquo;
    The winners don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re in the running until
    they get the phone call that they won.</p>
    
    <p>Gittip is <b>genius grants for the rest of us</b>. Call them
    pretty-smart grants, or crowd-sourced genius grants.</p>

    <p>Gittip is (<a
        href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/80">eventually</a>)
    for the local coffee shop owner that&rsquo;s really doing a lot for your
    town.  You&rsquo;re a fan. You buy coffee from her, but you want to do
    something more&mdash;a little something, not a big deal. If a hundred other
    people in your town feel the same way, it starts to add up. Now she can
    offer free coffee on Sunday mornings. Or whatever.  She knows what
    she&rsquo;s doing.  No strings attached.</p>

    <p>Gittip is (<a
        href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/80">eventually</a>)
    for the musician who gives their music away for free.  You love their work.
    You go to their shows, you actually pay for the downloads, but you want to
    make sure their family is covered. You want to chip in&mdash;a little
    something&mdash;so they&rsquo;re freed up to make great music.</p>

    <p>Gittip is (today) for your favorite open source hacker. You implicitly
    trust any software they write. You study their code. You want to free them
    up to write even more of it.</p>
    
    <p>Gittip is <b>Kickstarter for people</b> (not just projects).</p>

    <p>Gittip is <b>Flattr for people</b> (not just content).</p>

    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>Gittips are <b>weekly</b>. One-off contributions aren&rsquo;t
    enough.</p>

    <p>Gittips are <b>anonymous</b>. The people you gittip aren&rsquo;t told
    who tipped them. Also, you can&rsquo;t gittip more than $24 a week. This
    way, gittips come with no strings attached.</p>

    <p>Gittips are <b>public</b>. The total amount you give and the total
    amount you receive is public. Participants on both sides of the equation
    are rewarded publicly for their participation.</p>

    <p>Gittips are distributed <b>every Friday</b>. Gittips come out of
    your current balance (the money people have gifted you), and if
    that&rsquo;s not enough, Gittip can charge your credit card to make up the
    difference. We add an additional <b>30&cent; + 3.9%</b> fee when pulling
    money in from your credit card, to cover credit card processing (as well as
    hosting and other expenses). Recipients get the <b>full face value</b> of
    your gift to them.  If you give someone $3, they will have $3 in
    their Gittip account every Friday until you run out of money.</p>

    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that you have $5 in your account, and you
    are set up to give $0.25 to 30 people. Here&rsquo;s what we will charge
    your credit card on Friday:</p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: smaller; padding-left: 33%;">
        &nbsp;$&nbsp;0.25<br />
        <u>x&nbsp;30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><br />
        &nbsp;$7.50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total gittips<br />
        <u>-$&nbsp;5.00</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current balance<br />
        &nbsp;<b>$&nbsp;2.50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount needed</b><br />
        <u>+$&nbsp;0.30</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fee<br />
        &nbsp;$&nbsp;2.80<br />
        <u>x&nbsp;&nbsp;1.039</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;fee<br />
        &nbsp;<b>$&nbsp;2.91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount charged</b><br />
        <u>-$&nbsp;2.50</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;$&nbsp;0.41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total fee<br />
    </p>

    <p>Participants can withdraw funds from their Gittip account at any time,
    though this is currently <a
        href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/22">a manual
        process</a>.</p>
