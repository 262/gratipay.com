        <dt>What is Gittip?</dt>

        <dd>Gittip is a platform for sustainable crowd-funding. Use it to set
        up a 25&cent; per week (or more) anonymous gift to someone you think
        does great work.</dd>


        <dt>Who is Gittip?</dt>

        <dd>Gittip is owned and operated by <a
            href="http://www.zetaweb.com/">Zeta Design &amp; Development,
            LLC</a>, an <a
            href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open
            company</a> founded by <a href="/whit537/">Chad Whitacre</a> in
        2002.  Chad is the sole owner/employee of Zeta at the moment, meaning
        he's the only one authorized to access sensitive data. Anyone is
        welcome to <a href="/about/#get-involved">get involved</a> in building
        Gittip. The Gittip community includes a <a
            href="/on/github/zetaweb/">dozen people</a> actively building the
        product, and many more occasional contributors.</dd>


        <dt>How is Gittip funded?</dt>

        <dd>Gittip is funded on Gittip. As an <a
            href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open
            company</a>, Zeta doesn't pay any wages and has no profit. We <a
            href="/about/#details">charge a fee</a> to cover the things that we
        ourselves are charged for.</dd>


        <dt>Can I make a one-time tip?</dt>

        <dd>No. Gittip is designed for long-term, sustainable funding, and only
        supports recurring gifts at this time. We will probably offer one-time
        gifts in the future; you can join that conversation <a
            href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/5">here</a>.
        The workaround for now is to change your gift amount back to zero after
        the first week.</dd>


        <dt>I'm not in the U.S., can I still give using Gittip?</dt>

        <dd>Absolutely! We're able to accept international credit card
        payments. If you encounter any issues tipping and you are outside the
        U.S., please let us know.</dd>


        <dt>I'm not in the U.S., can I receive tips using Gittip?</dt>

        <dd>Yes. But, unfortunately, you can't automatically withdraw your
        gifts from Gittip unless you have a U.S. bank account (and in one out
        of ten cases, you'll also be asked to provide a U.S. Social Security
        Number as a means of identification). We're working on a solution for
        <a href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/126">non-U.S.
            withdrawals</a>.</dd>

        <dt>How do I withdraw money from Gittip?</dt>

        <dd>Participants in the U.S. can <a
            href="https://www.gittip.com/bank-account.html">connect a bank
            account</a> to have funds <a
            href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/30116848405/with-payouts-gittip-is-minimally-viable">deposited
            weekly</a> (less a $0.30 fee). It takes one business day for
        deposits to clear, so generally they will clear on Friday. Outside the
        U.S., payouts are <a
            href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/126">a
            manual process</a> (with postage and/or fees charged at cost).</dd>


        <dt>Can I pay with bitcoin?</dt>

        <dd>No. The challenges with bitcoin are handling recurring payments and
        transparently converting to USD. We are currently seeking help to <a
            href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/14">implement
            bitcoin tips</a>.</dd>


        <dt>Can I use Gittip to support organizations?</dt>

        <dd>Yes. Some accounts on Gittip represent organizations.</dd>


        <dt>How do I know my tips are being received by the right person?</dt>

        <dd>You can follow links to Gittip from a trusted source like a person
        or organization's website. Also, Twitter verifies accounts in instances
        where this is particularly relevant, so check their Twitter account
        carefully if it's linked.</dd>


        <dt>Do I have to pay taxes on the income I receive from Gittip?</dt>

        <dd>Maybe. Gittip is operating on the principle that money received
        through the site is a gift for tax purposes in jurisdictions where that
        is relevant.</dd>


        <dt>Are gifts I give through Gittip tax-deductible?</dt>

        <dd>No.</dd>


        <dt>I don't want to receive tips, I just want to give them. What should
        I do?</dt>

        <dd>Please select &ldquo;I'm not here to receive tips. I'll generally
        regift them&rdquo; as your personal funding goal.</dd>
