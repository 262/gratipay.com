  <h2>Want to get involved?</h2>

  <p>Thanks for wanting to help! This is the place to start. :-)</p>


  <h2>How does this work?</h2>

  <p>Gittip is a new kind of organization called an &ldquo;<a
    href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open
    company</a>.&rdquo; Anyone can volunteer to help with almost anything at
  any time, and <a href="/Gittip/members/">everyone who volunteers</a> gets to
  <a href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/eba0a27825b8">take some of the
    money</a> that has been given to Gittip&mdash;Gittip is funded on
  Gittip.</p>


  <h2>How is work divided?</h2>

  <p>We have three departments:</p>

  <dl>

    <dt><a href="business-development/">Business Development</a></dt>

    <dd>Find people and teams that want to use Gittip for funding. Find
    companies and foundations that are interested in investing in people and
    teams via Gittip.</dd>


    <dt><a href="community-engagement/">Community Engagement</a></dt>

    <dd>Engage people on Twitter and Facebook and other social media, and
    manage our GitHub issue tracker.</dd>


    <dt><a href="engineering/">Engineering</a></dt>

    <dd>Build products for Gittip.</dd>

  </dl>


  <h2>Where does work happen?</h2>

  <dl>

    <dt>1. IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</dt>

    <dd>We hang out in the #gittip channel on the Freenode network, and this is
    the best place to become a part of the community of people building Gittip.
    If you don't know what IRC is but feel brave, dip your toes in here: <a
      href="http://chat.gittip.com/">http://chat.gittip.com/</a>.</dd>


    <dt>2. GitHub</dt>

    <dd>Git<i>Hub</i> is different than Git<i>tip</i>! GitHub is where we
    manage our <a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com">source
      code</a> and keep track of and discuss <a
      href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues?direction=desc&sort=comments&state=open">open
      issues</a>. Diving in here is the second-best way to get involved.</dd>


    <dt>3. Twitter / Facebook</dt>

    <dd>We try to listen for feedback and conversations <a
      href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=gittip&src=typd">about
      Gittip</a> on Twitter, and we have the <a
      href="https://twitter.com/Gittip">@Gittip</a> Twitter handle and a <a
      href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gittip/229465400522758">Facebook
      page</a> as well. Gittip's founder, Chad Whitacre, is highly active
    on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/whit537">@whit537</a>.</dd>


    <dt>4. Google Hangouts On Air</dt>

    <dd>We do video conferences on Google Hangouts, which we live-stream and <a
      href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivwfG4q6DTAYCmRDmGpljRrpR3yNNSFP">post
      to YouTube</a>.</dd>


    <dt>5. Medium / Tinyletter</dt>

    <dd>We have a &ldquo;<a
      href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/latest">Building
      Gittip</a>&rdquo; collection on Medium where anyone can publish
    longer-form analysis and ideas. We also have an email newsletter called
    &ldquo;<a href="http://tinyletter.com/gittip">Roll on,
      Gittip!</a>&rdquo;</a> on Tinyletter, where we occassionally post
    summaries of work going on around the company. Here's the <a
      href="http://tinyletter.com/gittip/letters">archive</a>.</dd>

    <dd>The primary audience for both of these is people building Gittip. If
    you want the inside scoop but don't need it in real time, subscribing on
    Tinyletter (<a href="http://tinyletter.com/gittip">here</a>) or Medium (<a
      href="https://medium.com/feed/building-gittip">RSS</a>) is a good option.
    For real-time, use IRC or Twitter (above).</dd>


    <dt>6. Tumblr</dt>

    <dd>We have a <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/">blog</a>. The primary
    audience is the general public.</dd>


    <dt>7. In Person</dt>

    <dd>We're predominantly a distributed team, but we do sometimes come
    together at meetups and hackathons and conferences and whatnot.</dd>


    <dt>8. Email / Text / Phone</dt>

    <dd>We don't have private conversations if we can help it, but we'd rather
    hear from you privately than not at all. If you're not ready to jump in on
    one of the above forums, <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">email</a> Chad
    Whitacre or text/call him at +1-412-925-4220.</dd>

  </dl>


  <h2>What next?</h2>

  <p>Tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/Gittip">@Gittip</a> indicating what
  department you are interested in, and one of our community liaisons will help
  you get started with your first project.</p>
