  <h2>How does this work?</h2>

  <p>Thanks for your interest in helping out with Gittip!</p>

  <p>Gittip is a new kind of company called an &ldquo;open company.&rdquo;
  Anyone can volunteer to help with almost anything at any time, and everyone
  who volunteers gets a <a href="/Gittip/members/">share of the money</a> that
  has been given to Gittip&mdash;Gittip is funded on Gittip.</p>

  <h2>Sources of Truth</h2>

  <p>Here's where Gittip gets defined, most important to least:</p>

  <dl>

    <dt>0. Oral Tradition</dt>

    <dd>The burning heart of Gittip is the <a href="/Gittip/members/">team of
      people</a> that are building it together and the relationships we share
    with one another. Join us by diving in as further described below! :-)</dd>


    <dt>1. IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</dt>

    <dd>We hang out in the #gittip channel on the Freenode network, and this is
    the best place to become a part of the community of people building Gittip.
    If you don't know what IRC is but feel brave, dip your toes in here: <a
      href="http://chat.gittip.com/">http://chat.gittip.com/</a>.</dd>


    <dt>2. GitHub</dt>

    <dd>Git<i>Hub</i> is different than Git<i>tip</i>! GitHub is where we
    manage our <a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com">source
      code</a> and keep track of and discuss <a
      href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues?direction=desc&sort=comments&state=open">open
      issues</a>. Diving in here is the second-best way to get involved.</dd>


    <dt>3. Twitter / Facebook</dt>

    <dd>We try to listen for feedback and conversations <a
      href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=gittip&src=typd">about
      Gittip</a> on Twitter, and we have the <a
      href="https://twitter.com/Gittip">@Gittip</a> Twitter handle and a <a
      href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gittip/229465400522758">Facebook
      page</a> as well. Gittip's founder, Chad Whitacre, is highly active
    on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/whit537">@whit537</a>.</dd>


    <dt>4. Google Hangouts On Air</dt>

    <dd>We do video conferences on Google Hangouts, which we live-stream and <a
      href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivwfG4q6DTAYCmRDmGpljRrpR3yNNSFP">post
      to YouTube</a>.</dd>


    <dt>5. Medium / Tinyletter</dt>

    <dd>We have a &ldquo;<a
      href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/latest">Building
      Gittip</a>&rdquo; collection on Medium where anyone can publish
    longer-form analysis and ideas. We also have a &ldquo;<a
      href="http://tinyletter.com/gittip">Roll on, Gittip!</a>&rdquo;</a>
    newsletter on Tinyletter where we occassionally post
    summaries of work going on around the company. Here's the <a
    href="http://tinyletter.com/gittip/letters">archive</a>.</dd>

    <dd>The primary audience for both of these is people building Gittip. If
    you want the inside scoop but don't need it in real time, subscribing on
    Tinyletter (<a href="http://tinyletter.com/gittip">here</a>) or Medium (<a
      href="https://medium.com/feed/building-gittip">RSS</a>) is a good option.
    For real-time, use IRC or Twitter (above).</dd>


    <dt>7. Tumblr</dt>

    <dd>We have a <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/">blog</a>. The primary
    audience is the general public.</dd>


    <dt>8. Email / Text / Phone</dt>

    <dd>We don't have private conversations if we can help it, but we'd rather
    hear from you privately than not at all. If you're not ready to jump in on
    one of the above forums, <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">email</a> Chad
    Whitacre or text/call him at +1-412-925-4220.</dd>
