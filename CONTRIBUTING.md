## Contributing to Gittip

If you are opening a new issue or submitting a pull request, **go for it!**
Don't be afraid that it's a dumb idea or a duplicate of another issue or an
unwanted change or whatever. Maybe it is! We're still glad to have you! :^)

If you feel like we're ignoring your issue or pull request then call me
out ([@whit537](https://twitter.com/whit537)) on Twitter, or if you're
not on Twitter then <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">email</a> or even call me
(Chad Whitacre, +1-412-925-4220).
