## Team Gittip

First of all, thank you for your interest in Team Gittip! :smiley:

We welcome contributions of all types: design, code, discussion, marketing,
etc.


### Where We Hang Out

Besides GitHub, Twitter and IRC are the two main online hangouts for Team
Gittip. I'm [whit537](https://twitter.com/whit537) on Twitter, and we're in
 #gittip on Freenode for IRC (here's a [web
interface](https://webchat.freenode.net/)). Jump in and introduce yourself!
:grinning:


### Code

For typo fixes and other small changes, you can use the GitHub web interface to
propose changes.

To contribute more substantial changes, the first step is to install Gittip
locally, which is documented in the
[README](https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com). That file also documents
our testing framework. Changes with tests are better than changes without.


##### License

Gittip is [licensed under
CC0](https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/tree/master/LICENSE), i.e., it's
public domain. 


##### Collaborators

Gittip has a policy that anyone with four commits accepted into the repo is
invited to be a collaborator. It's opt-in though, so we'll ask you first (or
you can feel free to ask us if we're negligent) before adding you. Once you're
a collaborator you can commit to the main repo directly without having to
submit pull requests. Ideally collaborators represent people who think of
themselves as part of the Gittip team. If you don't contribute code for a while
(a year?) we'll probably retire your collaborator status.
