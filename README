This is Logstown, a gift economy.

Logstown is a cooperative escrow agent for recurring micro-gifts, or tips.
Possibly tip amounts per week are 0.00, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.64, and 1.28.

Friday is payday. On Friday, we charge people's credit cards and the money goes
into Logstown's (Zeta's) bank account. Money is allocated to other participants
according to tips. Participants may withdraw money at any time.
