This is Logstown, a gift economy.

Logstown is a system for funding creative producers through many small weekly
contributions. Contributions are called tips. Possibly tip amounts per week are
0.00, 0.99, 1.99, 2.99, 3.99, and 4.99.

Friday is payday. On Friday, we charge people's credit cards and the money goes
into Logstown's (Zeta's) bank account. Money is allocated to other participants
according to tips. Participants may withdraw money at any time.
