This is Gittip, a gift economy.

Gittip is a cooperative escrow agent for recurring micro-gifts, or tips.
Possibly tip amounts per week are 0.00, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.64, and 1.28.

Friday is payday. On Friday, we charge people's credit cards and the money goes
into Gittip's (Zeta's) bank account. Money is allocated to other participants
according to tips. Participants may withdraw money at any time.


Installation
============

The site is built with Python and the Aspen web framework, and is hosted on
Heroku. Samurai is used for credit card processing, and Google for analytics.

You need Postgres with headers installed. There's a simple Makefile for
building the software. All Python dependencies are included in vendor/. To
`make run` you need a local.env file in the distribution root with these keys:

CANONICAL_HOST=
CANONICAL_SCHEME=http
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost/dbname
GAUGES=false
SAMURAI_MERCHANT_KEY=
SAMURAI_MERCHANT_PASSWORD=
SAMURAI_PROCESSOR_TOKEN=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_CALLBACK=http://vcap.me/github/associate
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.1/lib

The GAUGES key is cruft and can go away (using Google Analytics).

The SAMURAI_* keys are problematic. I need to think about how to handle that
safely. Same with GITHUB_*.

The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH thing is to get psycopg2 working on Mac OS with
EnterpriseDB's Postgres 9.1 installer.
